## AGN Winds ðŸ‘‹

This site was used until October 2024 to develop the radiative transfer program Python.  We have transitioned this to a new site 
to reflect the fact that the name of our radiative transfer program has been changed to Sirocco, in order to avoid ongoing 
confusion with the scripting progarm of the same name. No new updates to this site will be made.

The new site is : https://github/sirocco-rt
