## AGN Winds ðŸ‘‹

This site was used until October 2024 to develop the radiative transfer program Python for simulating the spectra of winds in varrios astrophysical systems.  We have transitioned this to a new site  to reflect the fact that the name of our radiative transfer program has been changed to Sirocco. The reason for making this change was to avoid ongoing 
confusion with the scripting progarm of the same name.

The new site is : https://github.com/sirocco-rt

Active development of the code will occur there.  No new updates to this site will be made.
